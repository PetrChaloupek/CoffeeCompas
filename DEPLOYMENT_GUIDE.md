# How to put your app online

It is okay! It is your first time. We will do it slowly.

We are going to use a service called **Netlify**. It is free and very easy.

## Step 1: Find your files
I have built a special folder called `dist`. This folder contains your "finished" application.
It is located at: `/Users/petrchaloupek/CoffeeCompas/dist`

## Step 2: Open the Website
Go to this link: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
You will see a box that says "Drag and drop your site folder here".

## Step 3: Drag and Drop
1.  Open your Finder (file manager) on your Mac.
2.  Go to the `CoffeeCompas` folder.
3.  Find the folder named `dist`.
4.  Click and hold the `dist` folder.
5.  Drag it into your web browser, onto the box on the Netlify page.
6.  Release the mouse.

## Step 4: Done!
Netlify will turn green and give you a link (like `random-name.netlify.app`).
Click that link. That is your live app! You can send it to your colleague.
