# Final Step: Enable Deployment

1.  **GitKraken**:
    -   You will see new files (including `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
    -   **Stage All**, **Commit** ("Add deployment script"), and **Push**.

2.  **Go to GitHub.com**:
    -   Open your repository page.
    -   Click **Settings** (top right tab).
    -   On the left menu, click **Pages**.

3.  **Change Source**:
    -   Under "Build and deployment" -> "Source", change it to **GitHub Actions**.
    -   (If it was already on "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions").

4.  **Wait 1 minute**:
    -   Go to the **Actions** tab (top of page) to see it building.
    -   When it is green, reload your Pages settings to see the link!
