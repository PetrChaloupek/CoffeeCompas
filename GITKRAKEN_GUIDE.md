# Deployment with GitKraken

We are almost there. I have prepared the code. Now you need to create the repository.

1.  **Open GitKraken**.
2.  Click on **"Init"** (Initialize) to start a new project.
3.  Select **"Local Only"** (Keep it separate for a second).
4.  **Browse** to find the folder: `/Users/petrchaloupek/CoffeeCompas`.
5.  Click **"Initialize Repository"**.
6.  GitKraken will ask to **Stage** all files. Click "Stage all files".
7.  Type a message like "Initial commit" and click **"Commit"**.

## Connecting to GitHub
1.  In GitKraken, look for "Remote" on the left side (or push button).
2.  It will ask where to push. Select **GitHub.com**.
3.  Name the repository: `coffee-compas`.
4.  **IMPORTANT**: Make it **Public** (so the website works).
5.  Click **"Create and Push"**.

## Final Step (Publishing)
Once the code is on GitHub:
1.  Come back here and tell me "Repo is ready".
2.  I will run one final command to verify everything is working.
